codemash-schedulescrape
=======================

A cobbled-together hack to re-present codemash's schedule in web form. 

Specifically, this static javascript app pulls the raw JSON data used by EventBoard, parses it, then renders it in your browser as HTML.

It's really raw (I threw it together mostly on my plane ride over here). 

It'd be fun to hack on this with people here at Kalahari. Hit me up @ph1 on twitter.
