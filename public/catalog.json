If so, this is the session for you! In this TDD workshop we will be building the domain model for EverCraft -- a new MMORPG from Blizzards of the Coast. We have lots of story cards prepared covering features from combat to magic, classes to spells, and races to items. Plus, we'll be defining some of these cards during the session in case you want that +9 knife of ogre slaying or enjoy casting magic missile at the darkness.\r\rThis workshop is language agnostic and for all levels of developers. The focus is on TDD and emergent design but pair programming will be covered as well. The only requirement is that you bring a laptop and that you be able to test-drive you code with your language of choice. When you are done you will emerge a better programmer for the experience but there is small chance you will have a craving for Cheetos and Mountain Dew.",

If you're interested in adding organization and testability to an existing website, then the simplicity of backbone.js can help your incorporate those features with just a few libraries instead of a big JavaScript framework -- and the learning curve that comes with it.\r\rWe'll start by delving into the dark corners of JavaScript, examining the syntax, common practical patterns, and other idiosyncrasies. After our intro, we'll work on our example app, and turn \"pretty good\" JavaScript into code that displays separation of concerns and code that is easily testable. We'll use Backbone.js, the Underscore.js tools included with Backbone.js, and the Jasmine testing framework to treat your client-side code like a first class citizen without overhauling your existing application.",

There are hundreds of Roku-approved channels you can install, all built with Roku's public SDK.\r\rSo how do you build a channel? In this half-day precompiler, we'll put our Rokus into developer mode and start uploading our own application code to them, from Hello World to basic streaming to more sophisticated content collections. Roku apps are all about getting the viewer to their content and then getting out of the way, and we'll see how the API is optimized for that, but also how you can \"go big\" and do some neat stuff if that makes sense for your application. This being a streaming device, we will also cover how to create the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) streams that Roku supports.\r\rParticipants will need to bring the following: 1. A Roku 2nd or 3rd generation unit (Roku LT, HD, XD, XS, 1, 2, or 3 should all work) with its power cord. 2. The original remote control (using the Roku smartphone app WILL NOT WORK). 3. Some means of seeing what's on the screen, either via a capture card into your laptop (preferred) or a second display. You can also join the Roku developer program at http://www.roku.com/developer and download the SDK, although this is not strictly necessary to participate in the precompiler (the SDK primarily consists of documentation and examples).",

In our precompiler, we'll show you how to leverage these tools to improve an old, busted website that could use a little love. Indeed, there aren't any websites out there like that, but we\u2019ll arm you with some tools to change them should you ever encounter the rare case\u2026\r\rYou may be hearing more and more about Angular.js and Ember, but getting up to speed quickly on backbone is still a thing. If you're interested in adding organization and testability to an existing website, then the simplicity of backbone.js can help your incorporate those features with just a few libraries instead of a big JavaScript framework -- and the learning curve that comes with it.\r\rWe'll start by delving into the dark corners of JavaScript, examining the syntax, common practical patterns, and other idiosyncrasies. After our intro, we'll work on our example app, and turn \"pretty good\" JavaScript into code that displays separation of concerns and code that is easily testable. We'll use Backbone.js, the Underscore.js tools included with Backbone.js, and the Jasmine testing framework to treat your client-side code like a first class citizen without overhauling your existing application.",

But what about C#? scriptcs (https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs) is new way to develop C# applications as script. It leverages compiler advancements of Roslyn and combines the power of nuget to offer a low calorie approach to working with C#. It's great for prototyping, simple scripting or even building simple apps. Not only does it let you write scripted \"apps\", but it also includes a REPL so you can execute code interactively. You can even debug. Come to this talk and it will change the way you think about C# development.",

On the other, Clojure uses functional programming to provide a rich set of data manipulation functions. These two pillars of Clojure are fused together through the \u201csequence\u201d abstraction. Because of sequences, Clojure developers expect that almost any function works with almost any composite data.\r\rThis talk will consider how Clojure\u2019s approach to data differs from object-oriented programming and see how this approach changes the nature of your daily programming. We will also consider topics such as mutation, state vs value, and how to customize your primitive and composite data.

It's never been easier or cheaper to start a business, and whether you just have an idea you want to try out or you're hoping to augment your income and resume with some accomplishments outside of your current workplace, running and growing your own business can be very rewarding.\r\rIn this session, we'll talk about various kinds of opportunities and the commitments they require, employment agreement considerations, how to align your goals with your business, and how the low-risk option differs from the traditional startup approach.  Questions and discussion will of course be welcome as well.",

Web developers are creating in-browser templates and frameworks to help build these pages. Most of them look a lot like the server-side systems of old - HTML sprinkled with *place content here*. But what if there was a better way?\r\rD3 was created for data visualization - usually by creating SVG elements in the browser. The way it achieves this is by transforming data into a DOM. It has a declarative style that reduces the mental load on the programmer. By tying the data directly to its representation it enables transitions with little or no extra logic.\r\rHTML is not the goal of our template systems - the goal is a browser \u201cdocument\u201d. When our code lived on the server, HTML was the natural intermediate representation. But now that we are writing our software to run in the browser itself, we no longer need this middle-man.\r\rIn my talk I plan to explore client-side, data-driven page creation without templates by applying D3.

We will discuss benefits and limitations of this approach, best practices for getting started on the right track, and will leave attendees with information on additional resources for putting these concepts into practice with their own applications. Most importantly, we will walk through a real, functioning application written in C# and show how multiple build configurations can be used to target many platforms. Mac/iOS platforms will be targeted by MonoDevelop/Xamarin.iOS while Windows platforms will be targeted with Visual Studio 2012 using Windows 8 pro. The app demonstrated will not be a simple \u201cPong\u201d clone and will be a full platformer with touch integration.",

Unfortunately, popular solutions to user interface problems are sometimes actually counterproductive.\r\rIn this session, Michael Boeke will be discussing user experience antipatterns - design conventions that appear to be good solutions at first, but actually end up hampering usability. We\u2019ll look at a number of real life antipatterns collected from around the web, and explore some better approaches.

Often test environments have been on closed internal networks that are not accessible from the internet. Delivering and testing a mobile application on a 3G or 4G network changes all that. Coming up with a supported platform strategy is also paramount to success. One needs to take network speed, device features, screen size and resolution as well as multi-tasking life-cycles into effect when testing. QA testers will need to become familiar on how to service the devices they test with as well. Additionally the team will need to incorporate field testing prior to delivery. This presentation will organize the challenges a modern QA team has to contend with, and make some strong suggestions on how to craft a respectable Mobile Test Strategy.",

Once you make that decision you potentially have cut off access to other marketplaces.\r\rIn this talk, I will show you how you can create one application that deploys across the three major mobile platforms \u2013 iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.  To do this we will turn to Xamarin. Xamarin allows you to create a .NET backend for use with Windows Phone, iOS, and Android front ends. We\u2019ll discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this tool. When I\u2019m done, you\u2019ll know how to create a fully featured, standards-compliant, store-accepted app without the headache of maintaining three redundant codebases. \r\rYou have no excuse now not to get started creating the next great mobile app.",

            "Description": "In today\u2019s world of connected cloud-centric applications with rich user experiences, the need for asynchronous and event programming is bigger than ever. No language is an exception to the rule.  With the C# and Visual Basic language features added to .NET 4.5, an imperative approach to sequential composition and orchestration of asynchronous operations has been introduced. Come and learn how the Reactive Extensions (Rx) complement this feature set, adding the notion of multi-value asynchronous observable sequences with full-fledged LINQ support.  With JavaScript, you will learn about how it works with the world of callbacks, events, and Promises.\r\rIn this demo-intensive session, we will sketch out the asynchronous and event programming landscape, and dive into the unique role played by Rx. After explaining the design philosophy of Rx, rooted in the deep duality between enumerable and observable sequences, we will cover the rich set of query operators that enable complex event processing. And we'll show off examples of using Rx on each platform and for use cases from user interface with XAML or HTML, to server side complex event processing and asynchronous programming.\r\rDemocratizing asynchronous and event processing starts today!",

If we begin to think about our web applications as just consumers of an API, like how we build our native and mobile clients, we can achieve better separation of concerns, fewer lines of code, and UIs that we could only previously have dreamt about.\r\rAt the same time, we have to make sure that these 100% JavaScript apps don't break the key feature of the web: the URL. Users rely on the URL to bookmark, share and collaborate, but many JavaScript frameworks treat it like an afterthought.\r\rIn this talk, we'll examine the core architecture needed to build JavaScript applications that don't feel busted, then discuss the specific implementation of those details in Ember.js.",

Can you modify this list in real-time? Brainstorm & write prototypes in this tricky kata.\rMarshmallow Challenge\rThe Marshmallow Challenge is a remarkably fun and instructive design exercise that encourages teams to experience simple but profound lessons in collaboration, innovation and creativity.\rSimple Lists\rLists are one of the first data structures we learn as developers & perhaps, there are more to humble lists than what meets the eye. Come stretch your grasp of your favorite programming language with this simple, but involved kata \u2013 build & manipulate, search & maintain lists.\rRandori Workshop\rRandori refers to a software training exercise in which a group of people perform a kata, each performing one small step in front of the group.  The value in this lies in seeing how others approach a problem, and of course if the individual isn\u2019t sure of the next step to take, the group can offer suggestions.

And for good reason, it has opened possibilities that were previously impossible or impractical with other architectures (for example, Hadoop holds the record for world's fastest large data sorter, clocking in at 1.42TB/min this year).  With the volume of data rapidly growing, many have been forced to rethink their approach.  Several major organizations have Hadoop clusters running, including Amazon, EBay, Facebook, the NSA, and Yahoo, to name a few.  This session introduces solving problems with map-reduce, using the Hadoop API, the function of the core components of Hadoop, how other components of the ecosystem relate to each other, and how to test your jobs.  At the end of this session, attendees will understand the basics of how Hadoop works, what the components of Hadoop ecosystem are, and be able to write, test and run their first job.",

The original authors created Erlang for use in telecom devices which led to the creation of something that is different from any other language you use: completely functional with built in syntax for message passing between lightweight processes, designed to fail fast but with an application framework that deals with failure gracefully and with purpose.\r\rAs with anything new and different your first response may be fear and doubt. With its seemingly bizarre syntax and totally functional nature, Erlang seems unapproachable initially. It turns out that with a little bit of practice, the syntax begins to make complete sense and the functional aspects will open your mind to new ways of structuring your applications.\r\rIn this talk I will go through the basics of Erlang, explaining its syntax, providing code examples that show how to solve problems with functions, and talk about what Erlang is good at and what it is not so good at. So open your mind to Erlang and let me take you on a tour of this quirky and cool language.",

Although the language is mostly dead today, it drove the largest transformation of mainstream development tools since the creation of Unix 65 years ago.\r\rWe'll examine some key moments in JavaScript's history: its accidental rise to popularity; asm.js, allowing arbitrary software to run at native speed in browsers; the language ecosystem that grew up around asm.js, displacing JavaScript itself; the replacement of traditional Unix terminals, shells, and editors with new, higher-level equivalents running against the DOM; and finally, the inversion of the browser-OS relationship, still ongoing.\r\rThis story is told by someone who was a fervent JavaScript detractor during its rise. It was easy to see the language's numerous and glaring shortcomings, but miss the path that it laid out.",

Vagrant does exactly this, it is a tool to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments. In this session, I will show you how to create a development workflow that will allow developers to use Vagrant to create a real continuous delivery pipeline. This means understanding the environment needs as well as what is needed to run the software.\r\rIn this session I will demonstrate how to start with anASP.NET MVC application and have the ability to create an Ubuntu environment to run this in production as well as how to run the same application in a Windows environment. Iwill also show how we, at OpenTable, integrate Vagrant into our pipeline to allow us to create a good acceptance testing environment against known datasets rather than having brittle tests.",

You are almost guaranteed to hit someone who has worked with an MVC framework, and can probably name both a client side and server side example. But MVC, as it's typically defined, is not the only game in town. Component oriented frameworks have been giving developers a more productive and enjoyable way to build web apps for 10 years, and today the approach is gaining serious attention on the client side. Come see what component oriented development looks like, how it lets us work at a better level of abstraction and gives us a better way for designers and developers to work together. We'll also look at how the component oriented paradigm is finding new life on the client in both W3C standards and the most popular client side frameworks of right now.",

If we have a coding problem, we simply do a Google search or post a question on Stack Overflow for help. One subject that is not so easy for developers to learn is design.\r\rWe can write the most pristine code, but if our product is poorly designed, all is for not. The resources for design are simply too hard to find. There are many reasons for this, but mainly can be attributed to the difficulty of articulating the design process through which designers make decisions.\r\rThe truth is, there is in fact a process and framework for good web design. In this talk, I will cover some of the common pitfalls developers fall into and a few basic design principles from a developer's perspective. I will show how we can apply what we already know about programming to design. You'll gain a new appreciation for the invisible forces that guide good design decisions day-to-day. Your designer colleagues will be happier and most importantly your customers will be happier.",

Michael Feathers considers legacy code any code without a test, and in this case, he's right. But how do you deal with legacy code in order to make you feel confident that it's testable and that your changes will not affect other parts of the application? It's a tough task, but this talk will show some practices and techniques to make you more confident with your experiences with working on legacy code. We'll look at injection patterns, how to take advantage of mocking, and how to apply some simple design enhancements to your code to make it more testable.",

In this session I'll cover what motivated us to write it, the ideas behind the design, and actually walk through the code itself and the underlying database design to show it's relative simplicity.

However, there are many different ways that acceptance tests can be written, and choosing the right ones can mean the difference between success and failure for your project. This talk will get into the dirty details of dealing with AJAX, managing test data, keeping tests isolated, and working with your customer or Business Analyst.  The result will be cleaner tests that run faster and are easier to write.",

Prior to Ohio State she was a tenured professor at MIT for fourteen years. She is also a core member of a cross-disciplinary network of global leaders established by the Secretary of Defense to examine questions of emerging interest.\r\rAs a writer, she has most recently finished a manuscript Design Unbound, with co-author John Seely Brown, that presents a new tool set for designing within complex systems and on complex problems endemic to the 21st century.",
